# osu-templates

Templates for use when creating osu! dependent projects. Create a fully-testable (and ready for git) custom ruleset in just two lines.

**This repository has been merged with the main [osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu) code base for easier maintenance**. You can now find the templates [here](https://github.com/ppy/osu/tree/master/Templates).
